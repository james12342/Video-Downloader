Installer for OS X available: [Here](https://github.com/mayeaux/videodownloader/releases/download/1.0.0/videodownloader-1.0.0.dmg)

Installer for Windows available: [Here](https://github.com/mayeaux/videodownloader/releases/download/1.0.0/videodownloader.Setup.1.0.0.exe) 

NOTE: These installers are a bit outdated. The latest source code is your best bet as it has functionality to auto update youtube-dl on boot so it's always the latest version. I will recompile the app when I get a chance and update the executables here.
